# CLPS950-Final-Project---Tic-Tac-Toe

Hello! Our names are Zach and Sydney and for our final project for CLPS0950 Intro to Programming, we chose to design a tic-tac-toe game coded in Python. Our game consists of two playable modes: two-player and one-player. In the one-player mode, we designed an AI component to compete against. Our code can be ran in any Python-compatible platform. When playing the game, you will be asked to choose a number 1-9 in order to place your 'O' or 'X'. The spaces associated with these numbers go left to right first then top to bottom. For example, number 1 will be the top left corner, 2 will be the top row in the middle, 3 will be the top right corner, 4 will be the middle row left column, etc. We hope you have fun playing our game!
